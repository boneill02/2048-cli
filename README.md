# 2048-cli

[![run on repl.it](http://repl.it/badge/github/tiehuis/2048-cli)](https://repl.it/github/tiehuis/2048-cli)

Fork of a cli version/engine of the game [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048)=
for your Linux terminal.

There currently are 2 versions that can be run. This includes a straight-forward
terminal based version and one using ncurses. To add a new graphical interface,
simply create a .c file which implements all the functions in gfx.h and add a
Makefile entry.

Highscores are stored in `/usr/local/games/2048/[username]` by default. A ranked
highscore list can be shown by running `2048 -H` in machines with multiple local
users.

### Get
    git clone https://github.com/boneill02/2048-cli.git
    make

By default, termios.h is expected to be present for the standard terminal
version, and a VT100 compatible terminal is being used. If a VT100 terminal is
not available, simply alter the makefile and remove the '-DVT100' flag.
Compiling with ncurses requires the development libraries for it.

On an ubuntu/debian machine for example, these can be obtained via

```
apt-get install libncurses5-dev
```

You can also also easily install this on el >= 5 (CentOS, RedHat Enterprise Linux,
Scientific Linux, Oracle) and Fedora >= 19 using the package-manager:

```
sudo yum install 2048-cli[-nocurses]
```

For el you will need to have the
[EPEL-repository](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#How_can_I_install_the_packages_from_the_EPEL_software_repository.3F)
enabled.
